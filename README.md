# Project01
Javascript Gulp Project year 03

##Development
- 11/01/19 restarted by setting up repo
- 11/04/19 Doing several commits and making sure to understand how to utilize git properly, Wasnt aware that a 3rd page was a feature so I dont have a feature branch for that one I thought we needed it defaultly
- 11/07/19 Feature01 done made the site mobile friendly
- 11/07/19 : 11:47 Feature02 the 3rd page was made by default due to me having a misunderstanding, so this branch is dedicated to filling out the content instead.
